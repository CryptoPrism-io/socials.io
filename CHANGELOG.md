**Windows Users:**
```cmd
# Run once to fix permanently
setup_windows_utf8.bat
```

**PowerShell Users:**
```powershell
# Run once to fix permanently
.\setup_windows_utf8.ps1
```

**Git Bash Users:**
```bash
# Already configured automatically via ~/.bashrc
# If issues persist, restart Git Bash terminal
```

### Verify Unicode is Working
```bash
# Test system-wide Unicode support
python test_unicode_system.py

# Quick emoji test
python -c "print('üöÄ Unicode test: üíªüî•üë®‚Äçüíªüåü')"
```

### What This Fixes

**Before:** Scripts failed with encoding errors
```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\U0001f680'
in position 0: character maps to <undefined>
```

**After:** Unicode works automatically everywhere
```
üöÄ Unicode test: üíªüî•üë®‚Äçüíªüåü SUCCESS!
```

## üìö UNICODE ENCODING: Complete Documentation

### The Problem
- **Root Cause**: Windows consoles default to CP1252 encoding instead of UTF-8
- **Impact**: Python scripts crash when AI responses contain Unicode characters (emojis, special symbols)
- **Scope**: Affected all terminal types - Command Prompt, PowerShell, Git Bash

### The Solution: System-Level Fix

**Implementation Strategy**: Fix encoding once at the system level instead of per-script

#### Priority 1: System Environment Variables
- **PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8**: Forces all Python processes to use UTF-8 encoding
- **LANG=en_US.UTF-8**: Sets system locale for Unicode support
- **LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8**: Ensures consistent encoding across all applications

#### Priority 2: Terminal-Specific Configuration
- **Windows Console**: Set code page to 65001 (UTF-8) via `chcp 65001`
- **PowerShell**: Configure `[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8`
- **Git Bash**: Export environment variables in ~/.bashrc

#### Priority 3: Codebase Cleanup
- **Removed redundant fixes**: Eliminated per-script encoding setup code
- **Cleaner maintainability**: No more repetitive UTF-8 configuration in every file
- **Automatic inheritance**: All new scripts inherit system-level UTF-8 support

### How It Works

**System-Level Configuration:**
```bash
# Environment variables (permanent)
export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

**PowerShell Profile:**
```powershell
# Automatic UTF-8 console encoding
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = "utf-8"
```

**Windows Registry (via setup scripts):**
```cmd
# Permanent console code page
setx PYTHONIOENCODING utf-8
chcp 65001
```

### Benefits

**Developer Experience:**
- ‚úÖ No more encoding errors in any environment
- ‚úÖ No per-script fixes needed
- ‚úÖ Works automatically for all new scripts
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility

**Technical Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ System-level persistence across terminal sessions
- ‚úÖ Automatic inheritance by all Python processes
- ‚úÖ Reduced code complexity and maintenance overhead

**Business Value:**
- ‚úÖ Reliable AI response handling with emoji content
- ‚úÖ Consistent user experience across all environments
- ‚úÖ Reduced debugging time and development friction
- ‚úÖ Professional output formatting for social media content

### Validation Results
```
Tests passed: 5/5
üéâ EXCELLENT! System-level UTF-8 is working perfectly!
‚úÖ All Unicode tests passed without any script-level fixes.
‚úÖ Environment variables are correctly set.
```

### Rationale

**Problem Scope**: The Unicode encoding issue was a **fundamental system configuration problem** that affected every Python script using emoji or special characters. Previous per-script fixes were:
- **Inefficient**: Required modification of every affected file
- **Error-prone**: Easy to forget when creating new scripts
- **Maintenance burden**: Repetitive code across the codebase

**Solution Benefits**: The system-level approach provides:
- **Permanent fix**: Once configured, works in all new environments automatically
- **Zero maintenance**: No code changes needed for Unicode support
- **Professional standard**: Follows enterprise-grade environment configuration practices
- **Future-proof**: All new scripts inherit Unicode support automatically

**Business Impact**: Enables reliable handling of AI-generated content containing emojis and special characters, critical for social media automation where visual elements enhance engagement and user experience.

## [v1.2.1] - 2025-09-17 12:40 UTC

### üßπ CLEANUP: Template Deduplication & Path Resolution

### Fixed
- **Background Image Paths**: Corrected CSS background-image URLs to reference proper `../output/images/*.png` paths
  - `style.css` through `style5.css` now properly load background images
  - Fixed broken image references that caused missing backgrounds in Instagram posts
  - Templates now render with proper visual backgrounds from stored PNG files

### Removed
- **Duplicate Template Files**: Eliminated confusion by removing duplicate template structures

  - Updated script paths to reflect `src/scripts/` organization
  - Added comprehensive output directory structure documentation

### Rationale

**Path Resolution Critical Fix**: The background images were not displaying in generated Instagram posts due to incorrect relative paths in CSS files. The templates were looking for `1.png`, `2.png` etc. in the same directory as CSS, but images were stored in `output/images/`.

**Single Source of Truth**: Duplicate template files in multiple locations created confusion and maintenance overhead. Consolidating to `core_templates/` ensures:

- **Consistency**: All scripts reference the same template source
- **Maintainability**: Changes only need to be made in one location
