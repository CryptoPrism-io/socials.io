```cmd
# Run once to fix permanently
setup_windows_utf8.bat
```

**PowerShell Users:**
```powershell
# Run once to fix permanently
.\setup_windows_utf8.ps1
```

**Git Bash Users:**
```bash
# Already configured automatically via ~/.bashrc
# If issues persist, restart Git Bash terminal
```

### Verify Unicode is Working
```bash
# Test system-wide Unicode support
python test_unicode_system.py

# Quick emoji test
python -c "print('üöÄ Unicode test: üíªüî•üë®‚Äçüíªüåü')"
```

### What This Fixes

**Before:** Scripts failed with encoding errors
```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\U0001f680'
in position 0: character maps to <undefined>
```

**After:** Unicode works automatically everywhere
```
üöÄ Unicode test: üíªüî•üë®‚Äçüíªüåü SUCCESS!
```

## üìö UNICODE ENCODING: Complete Documentation

### The Problem
- **Root Cause**: Windows consoles default to CP1252 encoding instead of UTF-8
- **Impact**: Python scripts crash when AI responses contain Unicode characters (emojis, special symbols)
- **Scope**: Affected all terminal types - Command Prompt, PowerShell, Git Bash

### The Solution: System-Level Fix

**Implementation Strategy**: Fix encoding once at the system level instead of per-script

#### Priority 1: System Environment Variables
- **PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8**: Forces all Python processes to use UTF-8 encoding
- **LANG=en_US.UTF-8**: Sets system locale for Unicode support
- **LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8**: Ensures consistent encoding across all applications

#### Priority 2: Terminal-Specific Configuration
- **Windows Console**: Set code page to 65001 (UTF-8) via `chcp 65001`
- **PowerShell**: Configure `[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8`
- **Git Bash**: Export environment variables in ~/.bashrc

#### Priority 3: Codebase Cleanup
- **Removed redundant fixes**: Eliminated per-script encoding setup code
- **Cleaner maintainability**: No more repetitive UTF-8 configuration in every file
- **Automatic inheritance**: All new scripts inherit system-level UTF-8 support

### How It Works

**System-Level Configuration:**
```bash
# Environment variables (permanent)
export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

**PowerShell Profile:**
```powershell
# Automatic UTF-8 console encoding
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = "utf-8"
```

**Windows Registry (via setup scripts):**
```cmd
# Permanent console code page
setx PYTHONIOENCODING utf-8
chcp 65001
```

### Removed
- **Absolute Positioning System**: Eliminated all `position: absolute` CSS declarations causing layout conflicts
- **Sparse BTC-Only Layout**: Replaced minimal single-section display with comprehensive multi-section market analysis

### Rationale

**Critical Layout Problem Resolution**: The absolute positioning system was causing fundamental layout failures:

**Problem Analysis**:
- **Overlapping Sections**: Market cards were stacking on top of each other due to absolute positioning conflicts
- **Unpredictable Layout**: Absolute positioning created brittle layout that broke with content changes

**Data Architecture Enhancement**:
- **Unified Data Source**: Using `fetch_for_5()` ensures consistency between Page 1 and Page 5 market data
- **Real-Time Information**: Dynamic date/time display keeps content current and relevant
- **Complete Market Picture**: Dominance, global metrics, and key segments provide comprehensive market analysis

**User Experience Transformation**:
- **From Sparse to Rich**: Page 1 evolved from minimal BTC display to comprehensive market dashboard
- **Visual Clarity**: Auto-layout ensures all information is clearly visible without overlapping
- **Professional Presentation**: Card-based design matches modern financial dashboard standards
- **Information Hierarchy**: Natural flow guides user attention through market data logically

**Future Considerations**: This auto-layout implementation provides foundation for applying similar fixes to other templates that may have absolute positioning issues, as mentioned by user: "remember any changes we make in any other output we have to change for the absolute positioning."
