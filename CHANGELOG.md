**Windows Users:**
```cmd
# Run once to fix permanently
setup_windows_utf8.bat
```

**PowerShell Users:**
```powershell
# Run once to fix permanently
.\setup_windows_utf8.ps1
```

**Git Bash Users:**
```bash
# Already configured automatically via ~/.bashrc
# If issues persist, restart Git Bash terminal
```

### Verify Unicode is Working
```bash
# Test system-wide Unicode support
python test_unicode_system.py

# Quick emoji test
python -c "print('üöÄ Unicode test: üíªüî•üë®‚Äçüíªüåü')"
```

### What This Fixes

**Before:** Scripts failed with encoding errors
```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\U0001f680'
in position 0: character maps to <undefined>
```

**After:** Unicode works automatically everywhere
```
üöÄ Unicode test: üíªüî•üë®‚Äçüíªüåü SUCCESS!
```

## üìö UNICODE ENCODING: Complete Documentation

### The Problem
- **Root Cause**: Windows consoles default to CP1252 encoding instead of UTF-8
- **Impact**: Python scripts crash when AI responses contain Unicode characters (emojis, special symbols)
- **Scope**: Affected all terminal types - Command Prompt, PowerShell, Git Bash

### The Solution: System-Level Fix

**Implementation Strategy**: Fix encoding once at the system level instead of per-script

#### Priority 1: System Environment Variables
- **PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8**: Forces all Python processes to use UTF-8 encoding
- **LANG=en_US.UTF-8**: Sets system locale for Unicode support
- **LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8**: Ensures consistent encoding across all applications

#### Priority 2: Terminal-Specific Configuration
- **Windows Console**: Set code page to 65001 (UTF-8) via `chcp 65001`
- **PowerShell**: Configure `[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8`
- **Git Bash**: Export environment variables in ~/.bashrc

#### Priority 3: Codebase Cleanup
- **Removed redundant fixes**: Eliminated per-script encoding setup code
- **Cleaner maintainability**: No more repetitive UTF-8 configuration in every file
- **Automatic inheritance**: All new scripts inherit system-level UTF-8 support

### How It Works

**System-Level Configuration:**
```bash
# Environment variables (permanent)
export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

**PowerShell Profile:**
```powershell
# Automatic UTF-8 console encoding
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = "utf-8"
```

**Windows Registry (via setup scripts):**
```cmd
# Permanent console code page
setx PYTHONIOENCODING utf-8
chcp 65001
```

  - **Proportional Relationships**: Maintained relative font hierarchy while scaling absolute sizes
  - **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: rem-based units ensure consistent rendering across all environments

### Rationale

**Critical User Experience Issue**: Template 3 had significantly smaller fonts compared to Templates 1 and 2, creating an inconsistent and unprofessional user experience. The font sizes were so small they were barely readable in the 2160px viewport, undermining the entire template system's quality.

**Typography Consistency Standards**: Professional template systems require uniform typography scaling across all variations. The disparity between templates created confusion and reduced the overall brand quality of the Instagram automation system.

**Business Impact**: This fix ensures:
- **Professional Presentation**: All templates now maintain consistent, readable typography for social media content
- **User Engagement**: Properly sized text improves readability and engagement on Instagram posts
- **Brand Credibility**: Consistent typography across templates reinforces professional brand standards
- **Content Quality**: Template 3 posts now match the visual quality of Templates 1, 2, 4, and 5

**Technical Excellence**: The scaling approach maintains design proportions while achieving size parity, ensuring Template 3 integrates seamlessly with the broader template ecosystem.

**User-Driven Resolution**: Direct user feedback ("text is completely fucked up") led to immediate priority fixing of this critical typography issue, demonstrating responsive development approach.

**Validation**: Post-fix verification confirms Template 3 now displays with appropriate font sizes matching the established standards of Templates 1 and 2, with all text elements clearly readable and properly proportioned in the 2160px viewport.

## [v1.8.1] - 2025-09-22 (dev2 branch)

### üßπ CLEANUP: Project Structure Optimization & Code Quality Enhancement

### Removed
- **Obsolete Script Files**: Eliminated incomplete and redundant development files
  - **`src/scripts/instapost_new.py`**: Removed incomplete stub with missing functionality (94 lines of incomplete code)
  - **`src/scripts/instapost_restructured.py`**: Removed partially implemented script missing templates 3-6 (207 lines with incomplete functionality)
  - **`config/paths.py`**: Removed outdated configuration with incorrect template paths pointing to non-existent `src/templates/` directory
  - **`config/` directory**: Completely removed obsolete configuration system

### Fixed
- **Git Tracking Consistency**: Resolved inconsistent Git tracking that was causing VS Code folder dimming
  - **Added Missing CSS Files**: `style3.css`, `style5.css`, and `style6.css` now properly tracked in Git
  - **Unified File Tracking**: All output files now consistently tracked, eliminating mixed tracking status
  - **VS Code Visual Fix**: Resolved folder opacity issues caused by inconsistent Git ignore patterns

- **Local Server File References**: Updated `local_server.py` to use correct naming convention
  - **Template Links**: Updated from descriptive names (`top_cryptocurrencies_output.html`) to standard format (`1_output.html` through `6_output.html`)
  - **Consistent URLs**: All quick links now properly reference existing output files

- **Orphaned File Cleanup**: Removed legacy image files with outdated naming convention
  - **Deleted**: `ai_crypto_analysis_output.jpeg`, `crypto_vibes_output.jpeg`, `market_overview_output.jpeg`
  - **Deleted**: `portfolio_tracker_output.jpeg`, `top_cryptocurrencies_output.jpeg`, `trading_signals_output.jpeg`

### Enhanced
- **Code Quality Standards**: Maintained only production-ready, fully functional scripts
  - **Primary Script**: `src/scripts/instapost.py` - Complete implementation with all 6 templates (1007 lines)
  - **Publishing Script**: `src/scripts/instapost_push.py` - Dedicated Instagram publishing functionality
  - **Support Scripts**: Preserved `figma.py`, `gsheets.py`, authentication utilities

- **File Naming Consistency**: Standardized all output files to numeric convention
  - **HTML Output**: `1_output.html` through `6_output.html`
  - **Image Output**: `1_output.jpg` through `6_output.jpg`
  - **Template References**: All paths properly aligned with actual file structure

### Rationale

**Code Quality Improvement**: The removed scripts represented incomplete development attempts that could cause confusion and maintenance overhead:

- **`instapost_new.py`**: Only contained basic structure with missing data functions and incorrect viewport settings (1080x1080 vs current 2160x2700)
- **`instapost_restructured.py`**: Partially implemented with only templates 1-2, missing critical templates 3-6 functionality
- **`config/paths.py`**: Referenced non-existent directory structure (`src/templates/` vs actual `core_templates/`)

**Git Consistency Resolution**: Mixed tracking status was causing VS Code to display folders with reduced opacity, indicating version control uncertainty. Now all files have clear Git status:

- ‚úÖ **Tracked Files**: All production HTML, CSS, and image outputs properly version controlled
- ‚úÖ **Ignored Files**: `__pycache__/` correctly ignored with proper `.gitignore` configuration
- ‚úÖ **Clean Working Tree**: No inconsistent tracking patterns causing IDE visual issues

**Maintenance Efficiency**: Keeping only the functional `instapost.py` script (1007 lines with complete template 1-6 implementation) eliminates:

- **Development Confusion**: No more choosing between incomplete script versions
- **Path Resolution Issues**: Single script with correct template paths and output naming
- **Testing Overhead**: Only one script to maintain and validate

**Professional Standards**: The cleanup aligns with enterprise development practices:

- **Single Source of Truth**: One authoritative script for Instagram content generation
- **Consistent Naming**: All files follow numeric convention without legacy descriptive names
- **Clean Repository**: No orphaned files or incomplete development artifacts

**Business Impact**: Streamlined codebase improves:

- **Development Velocity**: Clear file structure reduces onboarding time for new developers
- **Deployment Reliability**: No risk of accidentally using incomplete scripts in production
- **Code Review Efficiency**: Reviewers focus on functional code rather than managing multiple incomplete versions

**Technical Excellence**: The retained `instapost.py` script provides complete functionality:

- ‚úÖ **All 6 Templates**: Complete implementation covering all design variations
- ‚úÖ **Database Integration**: Full PostgreSQL connectivity with proper data fetching
- ‚úÖ **AI Integration**: Together AI API for Bitcoin news generation (Template 6)
- ‚úÖ **Screenshot Generation**: Playwright automation with 2160x2700 high-resolution output
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and fallback systems

**Future Development**: Clean codebase foundation supports:

- **Easy Enhancement**: Single script easier to modify and extend
- **Clear Dependencies**: No confusion about which files are actually used in production
