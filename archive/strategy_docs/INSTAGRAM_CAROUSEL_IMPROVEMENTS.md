# Instagram Carousel Engagement Optimization Plan

## Current Content Analysis

**Image 1 & 2** (Top 25 Coins Grid): Information-dense but lacks hook
**Image 3** (Gainers/Losers): Great visual contrast, immediately engaging
**Image 4** (Long/Short Positions): Valuable for traders, good visual separation
**Image 5** (BTC Chart): Technical but needs context
**Image 6** (BTC Snapshot): Best storytelling with clear metrics and CTA

- Slide 3: "Which gainer did you catch? Comment below!"
- Slide 4: "Are you team LONG or SHORT? Vote in comments"
